**Question Statement**
----------------------
Implement the RMS scheduling algorithm without considering resource sharing and precedence. You should test your algorithm with a set of tasks.


----------
>This solution uses Java to implement the basic Rate Monotonic Scheduling. Following are the assumptions made:
 >1. All the tasks are independent.
 >2. All the tasks are periodic in nature.
 >3. The time period and deadline are one and the same.
 >4. Process switching takes negligible time.
 >5. All the given tasks are ready to be processed at time zero.


**How To Execute**

First line tells how many tasks are present in the current task set, let's say n.
Next 'n' lines contain period 'P' and computation time 'C' for each task.

**Sample Input**

    3
    4 1
    6 2
    8 3

**Sample Output**
```
This task set consists of 3 tasks. They are:
Task 0:
	Period: 4
	Computation Time: 1
Task 1:
	Period: 6
	Computation Time: 2
Task 2:
	Period: 8
	Computation Time: 3


##Note that this task set does not satisfy the schedulability check,
therefore there are chances of deadline misses.
=========================================================
The Execution Begins:
=========================================================
At time 0, task 0 has started execution
At time 1, task 0 has been completely executed.
At time 1, task 1 has started execution
At time 3, task 1 has been completely executed.
At time 3, task 2 has started execution
At time 4, task 2 has been preempted.
At time 4, task 0 has started execution
At time 5, task 0 has been comple84ely executed.
At time 5, task 2 has started execution
At time 6, task 2 has been preempted.
At time 6, task 1 has started execution
At time 8, task 1 has been completely executed.
At time 8, task 2 has been preempted.
At time 8, task 0 has started execution
At time 9, task 0 has been completely executed.
At time 9, task 2 has started execution
Task 2 finished at time 10 thus, missing it's deadline of time 8.

Process finished with exit code 0
